## build single-level wide file (each row = one defendant)
## need to create filtered case count (ncases13_ex::cases.py) first

# get all of the demographic data from everyone
# could use test name filters, but will still have a bunch of extras (e.g., agency contacts)
call = ("SELECT NameID, NameType, DLState, DLClass, DOB, Race, Sex,"

# number of cases + demos

# missing charge data for ~ 3000 people (as of 1.26) (how = left preserves all rows)
